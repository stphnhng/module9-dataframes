# Exercise 5: Popular Baby Names Over Time

# Read in the female baby names .csv file into a variable called `female.names`
# Remember to not load the strings as factors!

female.names <- read.csv("data/female_names.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Create a vector `years` as the year column of the dataset

years <- female.names$year

# Create a vector `names` as the name column of the datset

names <- female.names$name

# Create a vector `props` as the proportion column of the dataset

props <- female.names$prop

# Create a vector `names.2013` as your names vector where your years vector is 2013

names.2013 <- names[years == 2013]

# Create a vector `prop.2013` as the your props vector where your years vecctor is 2013

prop.2013 <- props[years == 2013]

# What was the most popular female name in 2013?

pop.name.2013 <- names.2013[prop.2013 == max(prop.2013)]

# Write a funciton `most.popular` that takes in a value `my.year`, and returns
# a sentence stating the most popular name in that year. Note how you had to make intermediary variables above.

most.popular <- function(input.year){
  names.input.year <- names[years == input.year]
  prop.input.year <- props[years == input.year]
  pop.name.input.year <- names.input.year[prop.input.year == max(prop.input.year)]
  
  return(pop.name.input.year)
}

# What was the most popular female name in 1994?

most.popular(1994)

### Bonus ###

# Write a function `how.popular` that takes in a name and a year, and returns
# a sentence with how popular that name was in that year


# How popular was the name 'Laura' in 1995?
